# erc721-token

1. This project deploys a ERC721 smart contract and allows you to mint unique NFTs. 
2. The unique NFT data is stored on IPFS which serves as a decentralized and a secure file system to store the assets instead on a centralized server.
3. Once you have deployed the smart contract and minted some NFTs you can run the frontend to view the NFTs you have access to.

Technologies: Solidity, JavaScript, HTML, HardHat, IPFS (Interplanetary File System)
